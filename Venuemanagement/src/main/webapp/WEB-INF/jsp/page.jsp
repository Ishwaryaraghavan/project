	<p>This is an Online event management system software project
		that serves the functionality of an event manager.
		The system allows only registered users to login and new users are allowed
			to resister on the application. This is a web application developed in Asp.
		net and Sql but desktop application of the same application is also available. 
		The project provides most of the basic functionality required for an event. 
		It allows the user to select from a list of event types. 
		Once the user enters an event type eg(Marriage, Dance Show etc), the system then allows the user to select the date and time of event, place and the event equipment’s. All this data is logged in the database and the user is given a receipt number for his booking. 
		This data is then sent to the administrator (website owner) and they may interact with the client as per his requirements and his contact data stored in the database.

		Third, taking part of the modules of online event management system, is the ability of organisers to pursue online ticketing. Purchasing tickets online is now easier than ever since interested parties can simply choose from a different array of tickets to match their budget and interests. For a concert, for example, this module can greatly help in making sure attendees get their preferred seating or area during the concern date.
		Fourth, a highly effective system is customised for mobile use. Many event organisers are currently looking into the benefits of a dedicated event app or an onsite check-in app that facilitates faster registration and attendee entry into the venue.
		The scope of online event management system may also have to be extended, especially when the organiser sees that there is a need for it. For example, networking may escape a lot of event organisers’ minds when these are in fact necessary to increase attendee turnout. There are some events that require prior interaction among interested parties in order for discussions and goals to be met more effectively. A conference on neuroscience among scientists can be made more interesting, for example, if the online event management system allows invitees to see who are coming – and to allow them to message one another. These way various parties can decide to come in groups thereby improving attendance.
		Another scope of online event management system in terms of networking is the ability to create communities. This will allow like-minded attendees to keep in contact with one another even after an event has passed. The amount of interaction among these leads can definitely bolster the success of future events.

Lastly, event organisers should consider branding when looking into an event management software. They need to find out if that they can use their own domain when creating an event website and if they can customise the website templates to how they see fit. The goal is to promote the organising company and the event – not the name of the software.

Those are only some of the modules and characteristics that an event organiser should look for in an effective online event management system.

	<p>Event organisers are continually appreciating the benefits of an online event management system such as an event management software. Organising an event is not an easy task, especially if the target audience is of a substantial size and if there are many teams involved during the execution phase. For this reason, automating the processes found in the event planning life cycle is a godsend to organisers who are still using old school methods. An online management system practically automates the organising process and leaves lesser room for human error. You may want to know the latest technologies and focus on an event planner software.
	The scope of online event management system may also have to be extended, especially when the organiser sees that there is a need for it. For example, networking may escape a lot of event organisers’ minds when these are in fact necessary to increase attendee turnout. There are some events that require prior interaction among interested parties in order for discussions and goals to be met more effectively.

<p>The good news is that the industry needed to create an events online event management system has been established in today’s modern world. There are a lot of options that one may encounter online with each of them having their own nuances that attract users. One may ask what the selling points of an events online event management system are. A simple search in Google can lead to various leads with many industry leaders offering similar modules to help event organisers.		
		While many of the organising processes are now automated through an event management online system, good website content is still necessary in order to compel people to come to a certain event. It’s not all about the system ergonomics after all. A successful online event management system also requires high quality copy in order to truly capture the interest of a target audience. An event organiser must still take heed of the event planning life cycle and make sure that he or she does not come short – especially in translating goals and benefits into the clearest form of communication.

Some other areas to work on for a good online event management system are: exhibition management, floor planning, content management and publishing. While these are very specific modules, an event organiser has to be all-inclusive in his or her approach to utilise a practical event management online system.
